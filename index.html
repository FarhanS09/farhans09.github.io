            </header>
            <main>
                <p>The gameweek 4 deadline is 11:00 UK Time on Saturday 14th September</p>
                <p>Key Injuries:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Martin Odegaard</li>
                    <li>Nathan Ake</li>
                    <li>Riccardo Calafiori</li>
                    <li>Niclas Fullkrug</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Team Lineups are generally released one hour before each game respectively</p>
                <p>Due to the international break, it has caused players to come up back to full fitness, so might see more rotation within teams who have a deeper squad depth</p>
                <p>In addition to this, some may have decided to hit their wildcard button, the key teams to target for this gameweek are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Manchester City</li>
                    <li>Liverpool</li>
                    <li>Chelsea</li>
